Title: Automatic Unit Handling for Numeric Vectors
Version: 0.1.0
Description: Adds a new class 'measure' for which methods of base functions,
    such as arithmetic and comparative operators and summary functions, are
    defined such that the units of 'measure' objects are automatically updated.
    Allows conversion between units, is compatible with various time interval
    objects, e.g. 'lubridate' periods, and has custom 'ggplot2' scales.
